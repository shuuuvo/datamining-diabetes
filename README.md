# Data Mining the Diabetes Mellitus Database
A coursework for my Data Mining module in my Master's.

## Description
The task of this coursework is basically data mining the diabetes mellitus dataset. Summary of the features available on the dataset is described at first. Then the cleaning of the dataset is done in the data pre-processing stage. After that, supervised model training and their evaluation is assessed. Lastly, unsupervised clustering is explored in the dataset. This report summarize all these contents. For supervised learning, Random Forest classifier yields higher accuracy of 87.21%. For unsupervised learning, 2 or 3 features could provide better clustering and good ARI and AMI scores.
